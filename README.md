# social-cal
A hobby project to manage event and birthday reminders and much more. Aim is to make a personal assistant like dear old Alfred who reminds me to talk to friends and wish them on important dates.

### ToDo:
[] Save Friend lists with name, location, birthdays and other meta-data
[] Create a simple front-end to save this data
[] Send reminders on birthdays and anniversaries
[] Save last conversation date (if applicable, more thinking/polishing required)
[] Reminder for conversations
[] Pull birthday/anniversary list from social web
[] Sync events with social web
[] Set events/reminders from this application into calendar app of choosing
[] Integrate don't break the chain routine into this (more thinking/polishing required)
[] Integrate with GraphQL as a query language for the data
[] Integrate GraphiQL (with FB login) so that people can import birthdays and play around/use it
